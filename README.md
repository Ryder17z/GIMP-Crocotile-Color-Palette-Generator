# GIMP/Crocottile Color Palette Generator
"Hardcoded" C++ application script to generate a palette file for GIMP &amp; Crocotile 3d. Also outputs a preview in HTML format.

Was written using VS Code on linux. Compiling on Windows is untested but should work fine.


Easy to modify if a different color palette is desired. Sample:
